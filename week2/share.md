## 继续上回的ON ENGINEERS AND INFLUENCE

1. Regardless, people who want to be managers in order to perpetuate a bad power structure are the last people you want to be managers

    无论如何，想要成为管理者以使权力结构不稳定的人是你想成为管理者的最后一个人 
    
3.  But what does engineering influence look like?  How do your powers manifest?
   
    但工程影响是什么样的呢？ 你的能力如何体现？
   

3. I am going to avoid discussing the overlapping and interconnected issues of gender, race and class, let’s just acknowledge that it’s much more structurally difficult for some to wield power than for others, ok?

    我将避免讨论性别，种族和阶级的重叠和相互关联的问题，我们只是承认，某些人掌握权力的结构要比其他人更难，好吗？


4. Doing is the engineering superpower. We create things with just a laptop and our brain! It’s incredible! We don’t have to constantly convince and cajole and coerce others into building on our behalf, we can just build.

   做是工程超最重要的一个环节。 我们用笔记本电脑和大脑创造东西！ 这太不可思议了！ 我们不必经常说服和哄骗和强迫他人代表我们建设，我们可以建立。




5. This may seem basic, but it matters. Creation is the ur-power from which all our forms of power flow. Nothing gets built unless we agree to build it (which makes this an ethical issue, too).

   这看起来很基本，但很重要。 创造是我们所有形式的权力流动的动力。 除非我们同意建立它（这也是一个道德问题），否则什么都做不成。



6. Facebook had a poster that said “CODE WINS ARGUMENTS”. Problematic in many ways, absolutely. But how many times have you seen a technical dispute resolved by who wasImage result for code wins arguments facebook willing to do the work? Or “resolved” one way.. then reversed by doing? Doing ends debates. Doing proves theories. Doing is powerful. (And “doing” doesn’t only mean “write code”.)
     
   Facebook有一张海报上写着“CODE WINS ARGUMENTS”。 绝对有很多问题。 但有多少次你看到技术争议解决了谁是代码的图像结果赢得了facebook愿意做的工作？ 或“解决”一种方式..然后通过做反转？ 做好辩论。 做证明理论。 做得很厉害。 （而“做”不仅仅意味着“写代码”。）
