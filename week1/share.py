   Let’s talk about influence. As an engineer, how do you get influence? 
What does influence look like, what is it rooted in, how do you wield it or lose it?
How is it different from the power and influence you might have as a manager?
   我们来谈谈影响力。 作为一名工程师，你如何能够拥有影响力？影响是什么样的，根源是什么，
你如何运用或者如何失去它？它与经理人的权力和影响有何不同？



   This often comes up in the context of ICs who desperately want to become managers 
in order to have more access to information and influence over decisions. This is a bad 
signal, though it’s sadly very common.
    这通常出现在迫切希望成为管理者的Information and computer science的背景下为了更多地
获取信息和影响决策。 这是一个糟糕的信号，尽管它很可悲。

   When that happens, you need to do some soul-searching. Does your org make space for
senior ICs to lead and own decisions? Do you have an IC track that runs parallel to the 
manager track at least as high as director level? Are they compensated equally? Do you Image

your decision-making processes mysterious to anyone who isn’t a manager? Don’t assume 
what’s obvious to you is obvious to others; you have to ask around.
   当发生这种情况时，你需要做一些自我反省。 您的组织是否为高级IC提供领导和自己决策的空间？ 
你有一个与经理人轨道并行运行的IC轨道至少和导演级别一样高吗？ 他们是否平等补偿？ 你是工程师软件
模因的个人贡献者的职业阶梯结果吗？ 对于不是经理的人，您的决策过程是否神秘？ 不要认为对你来说显而易见的是显而易见的; 你得四处询问
   If so, it’s probably their own personal baggage speaking. Maybe they don’t believe you.
Maybe they’ve only worked in orgs where managers had all the power. Maybe they’ve even 
worked in lots of places that said the exact same things as you are saying about how ICs 
can have great impact, but it was all a lie and now they’re burned. Maybe they aren’t used 
o feeling powerful for all kinds of reasons.
   如果是这样，那可能是他们自己的个人行李。 也许他们不相信你。 也许他们只是在管理者拥有所有权力的组织中工作。 
也许他们甚至在许多地方工作过，说过与你说IC如何产生巨大影响完全一样的东西，但这完全是谎言，现在他们被烧了。
也许他们不习惯因各种原因而感到强大。
